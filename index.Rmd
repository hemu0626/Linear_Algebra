### MTH017 Linear Algebra for Mathematical Science

Linear Algebra is a fundamental course in Mathematical Sciences. In
this module, we will introduce fundamental tools and basic theories for treating the
linearity of many variables and crunching collections of numbers (data). 

Roughly speaking, we will study vector geometry not only in the plane or space but also in n dimensional
space. (Imagine that your ratings of 100 movies put you as a vector in
100-dimensional space. Would you and five of your friends be actually sitting on a two dimensional
plane contained in the 100-dimensional space?) 

This module would be useful for future studies in mathematics and other disciplines, for example, statistics,
finance, engineering, computer science, physics, economics and so on. Linear algebra
also helps students to understand abstract concepts in group theory and quantum
mechanics. 

This course starts with solution of systems of linear equations, we will
discuss matrix theory, vector space, and matrix spectral theory and inner product
space. Together with the theory, we will introduce some case studies that aim to apply
the techniques in linear algebra for solving real world problems.
